# Link to Last Meeting (6/24): Bottable | Fiber UI Project | 6/24

## Goal
> “I think it’s crucial for us to have clear and focused fundamentals to direct all of us throughout this project. I think our mindset shouldn’t be “just start first” without clearly defining what our product, problem, and positioning are. Setting the foundation is an extremely important first step that will set the tone for this entire project. We should come out of the meeting knowing exactly what we want to make, how it will solve the problem, how are we different, what’s the narrowed-down design brief? We should be very clear on what to answer when your parents ask you, “what’s your side project about?” Then, we can move on to work.” 

## Main Questions to Discuss 
1. What exactly will the product be and what types of interface will it be? 
    - What type of data will our program track? 
2. What’s our positioning? How do we stand apart from all the other existing products/services? 
3. In one sentence, what is the project and what does it need to do? (Simple & focused) 
4. What to reconsider: 
    - Name 
    - Meet / Idea 
    - Mission statement 
    - Deadlines

# Link to Last Meeting (6/24): Bottable | Fiber UI Project | 6/24

## :goal_net: Goal 
> “I think it’s crucial for us to have clear and focused fundamentals to direct all of us throughout this project. I think our mindset shouldn’t be “just start first” without clearly defining what our product, problem, and positioning are. Setting the foundation is an extremely important first step that will set the tone for this entire project. We should come out of the meeting knowing exactly what we want to make, how it will solve the problem, how are we different, what’s the narrowed-down design brief? We should be very clear on what to answer when your parents ask you, “what’s your side project about?” Then, we can move on to work.”

        - Price (Amazon, eBay)
    - Why is our product special?
        - Centralized platform for all websites trackings
        - Templating, essential selection presets for major websites
        - Machine Learning to predict selection (autofill?)
            - Basically tagging websites, we gather data of fields and take advantage of it.
